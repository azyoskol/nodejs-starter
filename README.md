# nodejs starter

A boilerplate for Node.js web applications.

When I started this project, my primary focus was on simplicity and ease of use. I also tried to make it as generic and reusable as possible to cover most use cases of web apps, without being too specific. In the worst case you can use this as a learning guide for your projects.

## WORK IN PROGRESS

I don't recommend use this project right now.

## Getting Started

The easiest way to get started is to clone the repository:

```bash
# Get the latest shapshot
git clone https://github.com/azyoskol/nodejs-starter.git project-name

# Change directory
cd project-name

# Install npm dependencies
npm i

# Then simply start your app
npm start
```

## How use

You can use you favorite text-editor, but more comfortable work I recommend use [vs-code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Since I working on setup best configuration for work process.

Tips:

- Use workspace. Path to current workspace `./vscode/workspace.code-workspace`
- Debug. Use vs-code debug tools because this repository has awesome configuration. It help you improve your productivity.
